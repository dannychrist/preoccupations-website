Preoccupations Website:

This is a website I made for my band 'Preoccupations'. I designed it using React, Node, and CSS. I used the MailChimp API for newsletters and the SongKick API to display upcoming shows. The site is deployed through Google App Engine/Google Cloud Service.

Check it out! Or to test the site locally, using two terminals, yarn install/start the BACKEND and FRONTEND folders.
